##Local Weather Application 

This project displays local weather information using HTML5 [Geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/geolocation), [Dark Skys](https://darksky.net/dev/) and [Skycons](https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/).

Here's a preview:

Features animated weather icons called [Skycons](https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/) and animated gradient background with colors representing current weather condition.

####TO-DOs:
(Hopefully work on them when I feel like it): 
* ~~Make web application media responsive~~
* Request Dark Sky API weather data via Proxy API Server instead
* Add local time to weather description
* Use Google Maps Geocoding API to integrate a search bar to see weather in other locations
* Fahrenheit and Celsius conversion choice according to country code
